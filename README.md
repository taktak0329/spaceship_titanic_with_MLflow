# XGBoost model tracking with MLflow
made a machine learning model using XGBoost for the dataset called "spaceship_titanic" uploaded on Kaggle.
model results are logged onto MLflow \n
I uploaded two files named "xgboost.ipynb" and "xgboost_with_ctgan.ipynb". the former is just a xgboost model learning original spaceship_titanic data, the later uses CT-GAN to create synthesized data set from the original data, and learn xgboost with it.
